            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>Through interviewing Kaitlynn, a Sheridan College student that also lives in the neighborhood it gave me meaningful insight into how this issue not only affects me but others who also live in the same neighborhood and have experienced this problem first hand. She shared the insight into how she also noticed that frogs had often resorted to venturing outside their fenced enclosure mostly at night or right after sun down more often after it rains. Her thoughts on how the frogs are dark and blend into the darkness its quite evident how someone would fail to notice them and unintentionally step on them without even realizing it, was quite insightful and left more concerns in my mind on how to help them. Especially since you can’t go ahead and dye the frogs a different color or make them reflective. Nowadays she told me she avoids walking around that area to avoid any unforeseen mishaps and mistakenly harming them, while also pointing out that there are no signs or warnings disclosing the potential animal crossing or in this case frog crossing. With her remarking that there's not enough being done to protect the frogs or the local wildlife because the fence just seems like a haphazard I did something to fix, with gaps allowing animals to easily go through the gate. This shows me that there is someone in the community that recognizes the same problem as me but is unable to do anything to help the wildlife as well making her feel powerless.</p>
            <p>The secondary research just confirmed that this issue isn’t isolated to a local one but rather a larger global consequence. With both sources just showing me there are other people in the world that recognize and care for wildlife just as me and Kaitlynn do in our neighborhood.  This research helped me to understand that there are real world solutions that communities and cities in other places have introduced that were effective in protecting these innocent animals.</p>
            <p>Together with both the interview and the research, it helped me understand that people do not see them as just frogs, but living beings that need a little help to survive and how my topic is both realistic and necessary to address. In order to make sure they will be around for future generations.</p>
