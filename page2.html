            <h2>Point of View (POV) statement</h2>
            <p>A local Sheridan College, that lives in the same neighborhood needs a way to prevent frogs from ending up on sidewalks and roads at night and after it rains as the fence that encloses their habitat is ineffective with no visible signs or infrastructure protecting the frogs or raising public awareness.</p>

                <p><strong>Amphibian road mortality drops by over 80% with wildlife underpasses, study shows</strong><br>
                By: University of Vermont<br>
                <a href="https://phys.org/news/2025-05-amphibian-road-mortality-wildlife-underpasses.html" target="_blank">Read Article</a></p>

                <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Road deaths can be reduced by over 80% using wildlife underpasses or fences.</li>
                    <li>These help frogs cross roads safely, especially at night or in rain.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Connection to My Problem:</h4>
                <p>Frogs from the nearby pond are being stepped on or run over. The fence isn't enough. Adding guiding systems like in the study could help protect them.</p>

                <p><strong>Effects of road mortality and mitigation measures on amphibian populations</strong><br>

                <h4>What I Learned:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Roads are a major cause of frog deaths worldwide.</li>
                    <li>Near migration routes, roads cause population declines and isolation.</li>
                    <li>Solutions like tunnels and awareness campaigns help.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Connection to My Problem:</h4>
                <p>This confirms my local frog issue isn't unique. If people don't care or know, the deaths will continue. The research supports the need for solutions now.</p>
