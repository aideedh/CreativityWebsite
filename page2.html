            <p>A local Sheridan College, that lives in the same neighborhood needs a way to prevent frogs from ending up on sidewalks and roads at night and after it rains as the fence that encloses their habitat is ineffective with no visible signs or infrastructure protecting the frogs or raising public awareness.</p>

                <th>What I Learned</th>
                <tr>This academic research study emphasized that roads account for a large portion of the mortality rate of frogs globally.</tr>
                <tr>Especially when roads are near migration paths for these animals it leads to declines in their population and genetic isolation causing issues later on.</tr>
                <tr>Municipal efforts and public awareness play a key role in implementing solutions like tunnels or rescue efforts</tr>
