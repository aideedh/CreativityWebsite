            <p>A local Sheridan College, that lives in the same neighborhood needs a way to prevent frogs from ending up on sidewalks and roads at night and after it rains as the fence that encloses their habitat is ineffective with no visible signs or infrastructure protecting the frogs or raising public awareness.</p>

            <p>This question is the most useful because it focuses on a realistic approach that will provide an immediate solution to the problem that could be implemented. Without the need to explore other more complicated solutions that can be more costly or surrounded by bureaucracy such as getting better fencing or implementing wildlife tunnels. </p>
            <p>Public awareness is a key part to addressing the situation, raising awareness for drivers and pedestrians can significantly reduce the harm done to the frogs. It also provides knowledge to the members of the community who may have otherwise not known about the issue in the first place.  This question is both simple and doesn’t require large amounts of money to tackle the problem at hand. With the key cause for the death of these animals being lack of visibility and awareness at night when the frogs are most at risk. </p>
