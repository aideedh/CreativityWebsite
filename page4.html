            <h1>Top Idea</h1>
            <h2>Glow in the Dark Frog Crossing Signs</h2>
            <p><strong>Idea Expanded:</strong></p>
            <p>Glow in the dark frog crossing signs with a QR code placed on one hand to raise awareness when scanned, positioned along key sidewalk and road areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Short Rationale:</strong></p>
            <p>To me this sounds like the best idea overall while being the most cost effective solution it is also easy to install and remove on an as needed basis. These signs would also require no electricity as they would be designed like normal traffic signs with reflectivity allowing them to be seen when its night as well. </p>
            <p>This approach eliminates the need for additional materials like phones, pamphlets, or newspapers, making it the most viable medium to convey information. The Frog shaped design would also grab the attention and encourage curiosity and a small qr code can be placed on them for anyone who scans it.</p>
            <p>These signs can be placed by the community or by the city, with it being non intrusive it can be removed if any problems arise. Although this may not be the most complete solution to eliminate the death or injuries towards the local frogs, this is the most effective solution to raise awareness while not involving government bureaucracy.</p>
