        <h1>What exactly is the problem?</h1>
        <p>There is a pond near my house that's enclosed by a gated metal fence, which houses a variety of wildlife of which I am focusing on, in particular frogs. Sometimes, during the summer spring / summer months most often after rain when past dusk, later on into the night the frogs like to leave the enclosed area of the metal fence to venture off outside from what I have seen from my walks outside. This results in them ending up on the sidewalk and the road right beside the pond. Unfortunately this results in unfortunate accidents with pedestrians unknowingly stepping on them or vehicles running them over when they end up on the road. Leading to unnecessary deaths that could have otherwise been avoided if there was awareness of this problem. This only further serves to disrupt the local ecosystem of the pond, making this an issue worth writing about.</p>
        <h2 id="fix">Why do you think this is a problem worth solving?</h2>
        <p>This is an important issue that affects local wildlife and the preservation of the ecosystem. Frogs play a vital role in the environment controlling the insect population and maintaining the balance making sure there isnâ€™t an overpopulation of mosquitos in the area. This reflects negatively on the planning of the neighborhood not taking local wildlife into account when planning for protective measures to save the lives of such innocent existences. Addressing this problem would enhance the communities environmental responsibility and further contribute to conservation efforts.</p>
        <p>I want to help them, live there is no need for them to die in such a preventable way.</p>
