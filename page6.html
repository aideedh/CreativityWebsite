    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>
    The process of refining my creative problem solving project, I learned that creativity is not just about smashing ideas together in order to create something but about the process of structuring ideas to make them more applicable / meaningful. One of the most important lessons I learned was that even simple ideas like a sign or a pamphlet can have a meaningful impact when raising awareness about an issue if it is well designed and thought out to convey its intentions properly.
    </p>

    <p>
    The thing that worked best for me was the process of visualizing the idea process and combining it with my ideas. For instance, the fishbone diagram really helped me understand the core problem and how I could start to tackle it. The visualizing aspect also helped me determine which solution would lead to the best outcome with the generation of 25 plus ideas. It helped me narrow down the best idea using a checklist type design crossing things out that I felt wasn't the best overall.
    </p>

    <p>
    One thing I would do differently next time is start earlier and experiment with more formats. I also realized that I tend to second guess my ideas too quickly, and I want to work on being more confident during the early stages of ideation.
    </p>

    <p>
    This project helped me reflect on how I approach challenges and confirmed that creativity thrives when I give myself permission to explore freely then evaluate later.    
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Overall, this project taught me that creativity is a flexible process that combines imagination with strategy.
      I learned to balance exploration with evaluation and to trust my instincts more. The creative problem solving
      framework gave me a clearer path to follow, and I now feel more confident about tackling open ended challenges
      both in school and beyond.
